Meditations.

Your values and lessons from life to be remembered. (As jotted down in the moment and excerpted from your little blue journal.)
---
1. Peace with honour. 
2. Reputations are fickle and change with wind and word; pay no heed to them, and never worry over your own.
3. Let your inner self be even more visible than your outer. 
4. Today’s weakened foe is tomorrow’s vengeful threat. Never leave matters unfinished; it is cruel.
5. Eat what you want to eat; dress how others want to see you – a translated proverb (mahavra) from your mother. 
6. Silence is one of the great arts of conversation. Wield it skillfully to unravel its power.
7. Danger lies where we least expect it. Security is man’s chiefest enemy. – your mother. 
8. History  is what separates us from the animals. 
9. Measure everything in time; it is your most valuable resource. Do not waste it. This is your secret to a happy life. 
10. So what? – your father. 
11. God has given you two ears to listen, and one tongue to speak. 
12. You will only ever be either loved, or be understood. This is your own pain to bear; in this clarity you will find your salvation.  
13. In a world of excesses, that which you can temper is what you can control. 
14. Control everything within you, but do not attempt to do so for others. Do not delude yourself of your individual relevance.  
15. Note how someone speaks; it reveals what they care most about. Note how they write; it reveals how and from where they learn the things they care about. 
16. Consolidate control.
17. Ask questions of everyone wherever you go.
18. Manage by wandering around; stagnation is complacency and complacency is the brother of peril.
19. Accept humbly; let go freely. 
20. You do not fear making a decision, but you often fear being misunderstood in your process. In those moments you are foolishly being subservient to those looking for someone to follow. Lead the way until you do not need to.
21. Serve through leadership; unanimity is a pipe dream.  
22. When provoked, remember that your reaction alone dictates whether the provocation becomes a talking point afterwards.   Look at provocation as bait, recognize it, but do not be pulled by it.  
23. Like in a stream of water shooting out of a fountain: when the droplets are few and spaced their motion seems rapid and energetic, but at the very stem of the stream where the droplets are many and clustered the motion seems slow even if coordinated. There is a balance to be found between organization in numbers and efficiency. Naturally, in a fountain stream it is at the maxima.
24. People want to feel smart. Show them their smarts.
25. Maintain a hard heart. You can soften it if needed. 
26. People greet a rising sun. A translated proverb (mahavra) from your mother. (Jan 17th, 2021)
27. You are free like your mother named you. (Jan 18, 2021)
28. A mosquito has bit you? Bite the mosquito. (Your father’s advice from as far back as you can remember.)
29. What is on paper is not the real world. It is a world.
July 22, 2021
1. If not you, then who?
2. “Easy come, easy go.” - your mom, Fatima, speaking on streams of income and different industries and the dangers within.
September 15, 2021
1. “If you want to do big things you have to do them fast.” - Donna Shalala during healthcare crisis class talking about Clinton healthcare plan.
October 10, 2021
1. Your friends are one of your greatest weaknesses. Not because there is something wrong with them but because you are unable to say no to them. 
2. Talk to those around you. Talk especially to those not around you.
3. Philosophy is the calculus of life; it is undeniably a basal discipline— a child to Logic and sister to Mathematics.

Instead of admitting that you accidentally knocked the bottle off the table, you knock another one down intentionally and claim you knowingly, determinedly knocked both down. That is a conversation you can control with your grasp of language. You will toy with words and perceptions until the other person can see why you did what you did. You will be "satisfied" with this. Only, now you have blinded yourself as well as the other person from the reality.

You let yourself feel intensely, but cruelly you reject this humanity from yourself as soon as you accept it. You live to give yet you fear taking, for being indebted to someone else feels like giving up a portion of your freedom. What is there that another man can do that you can not do yourself with some perseverance? Nothing. Why then give up your freedom so cheaply, and only for a momentary lack of courage to face some perseverance?
Recognize that your expectations are unfair. You expect an unbelievable amount of demonstrated effort before you allow yourself to even consider showing yourself to someone.

Lights on used to provide such a weird sense of comfort and wonder as a child. Like a sign of life but also of safety and beauty. I still can't help but wonder at them now as I walk in central parks and look up to see the looming beacons of man  overhead.

On a long enough timeline, selfishness reveals itself to be shortsighted gratification in exchange for long-term failure. We as a species still aren't very good at assigning proper value to things that don't immediately affect us.
We don’t have a long history of society at such a huge scale. We’re still iterating solutions.
We do have limited time left on a few critical issues - climate change and mass extinction. But, these are solvable.
Today, we’re really learning the power of communication tech in creating shared narratives that guide real action. Unfortunately, this has been used in pretty shitty ways so far.
But, it seems like people are starting to understand our interconnectedness and are organizing for meaningful collective action that respects the dignity of all life.

Advancements
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

It’s funny to think humans once thought the Earth was the center of the universe. But then again, now we see ourselves as the enter of the planet. We point to our technology and say we’re the smartest. But do computers, cars, and factories really illustrate how intelligent we are? Or do they show how lazy we have become? We put this “civilized” mask on. But when you strip that away, what are we? Ww think of ourselves as Gods, but don’t say it. We know very well of our faults, but never admit to them.

How quickly we forget that only within the past hundred years did we allow women to vote; allow, on paper, for blacks to live as equals. We act as if we are all-knowing beings, yet there is much we fail to see. We walk down the street ignoring all the little things. The eyes who stare, the stories they share. Seeing everything as a background to “me.” Many years from now, a civilization will look back at our remnants and conclude that we “were not ready to listen, or to think.” Can we truly claim this as a falsity when it is exactly our lack of thinking that has caused our larger issues of climate change, overpopulation, and much more?

Plague

The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

We are like a plague sweeping the earth, tearing apart the very environment that allows us to live. We see everything as something to be sold, as an object to be owned. But what happens when we have polluted the last river? Poisoned the last breath of air? Have no oil for the trucks that bring us our food? When will we realize money can’t be eaten; that it has no value? Money feeds neither the body nor the heart: it merely allows us to barter for what is already free to us all. 

Barter
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

In the ancient world, bartering was not a way of acquiring something but rather it was a lifestyle. A simple this for that ran everyday interactions until the one moment when one bad trade was made.

We traded the Earth for some money and no one expressed any doubts or ever asked why.

And as a result: Where there were trees that cleaned our air are now factories that poison it. Where there was water to drink, is now toxic waste. Where animals ran free, are factory farms where they are born and slaughtered endlessly for our satisfaction. Over a billion people are starving, despite us having enough food for everybody. Where does t all go? Seventy percent of the grain we grow is fed to fatten the animals you eat for dinner. Why help the starving? There’s no potential to profit off them.

Value
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

Amani, an eight year old Kenyan boy, wakes up. The young boy, groggy from sleep and hunger stumbles left and right as he leaves his hut. Seeing his father and the rest of the village in the Village Center, he proceeds towards the area with every last vestige of power. Confused, he looks around for any reason behind the gathering, but finds nothing peculiar. The procession, now aware of Amani’s inability to hurry, walks towards him; bringing with it an aura of pity around each man. The young boy halts; weary and attempting to focus his eyes, he carries with him the face of death. Amani, is informed by his father, the gatherer of the village people, that a village doctor had diagnosed Amani during his sleep and that the doctor had reached his conclusion: Amani would be dead within one or two days.

That same night, lying on the ground in his hut, Amani nonchalantly used his Nokia mobile phone. Aware of his limited time, he sought to see some places of the world he had always heard about. He searched for pictures of large cities like London, New York, Paris, and Hong-Kong. With a smile on his face illuminated by the glow of his phone in the dark hut, he gazed at his phone’s screen: he was wholly consumed by the feeling of being in the pictures he was seeing. His admiration was left abrupt due to a text message from the local cell phone carrier, Orange; he had very little bandwidth left on his mobile phone in Kenya. Wanting to be distracted by the conditions of his own village and his own life, he proceeded to go on a news website.

“Over 100 killed in deadly shooting at grocery shop,” the headlines in bold with a supplementary three page article. Amani felt sorry for the loss of life. So would any human. He was reminded that there are flaws in even the most beautiful of lives; he was also reminded that he is part of a community of people who do not have faces, but only arms. Amani continued to read the article; alone, in a village on the borders of Kenya and Tanzania, Amani died with no headline, no commotion, and no face. 

Protons
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

As a child sitting near the window of a slow driving car, it was hard not to observe the world around me. Epiphany hit when I made the absurd realization that humans are just like atoms. Countless nights were consumed by the thought that each person around me was living their own life, doing their own things, thinking their own thoughts but ultimately also affecting my own world. No longer was I able to look at a person without imagining their head to be surrounded by whizzing electrons.

As the number of sleepless nights went up so did the amount of sense my idea made to me. It was simple: the nucleus represented the individual person, the protons were synonymous to the characteristics and the uniqueness of said individual, and the neutrons stood for the innate and common human psyche, or what I now know as the collective unconscious. The electrons are what fascinated me the most, however.

Like electrons, people come and go in unfathomable speeds. The atoms who choose to embrace these electrons become charged, powerful, and able. In the long run they remain successful. Those who fail to see the value of the electrons around them end up suffering. The concept was simple then but only now do I realize how profound the observation was. It is a definitive relation between the micro and the macro world; a reminder that at a fundamental level, everything follows the same rules— even human society. Today, this observation allows me to recognize myself in others and in a world of constant conflict this recognition and model of human coherency serves as a symbol go unimpaired and largely intact unity between the human race and everything else. The idea that a book and I are fundamentally the same thing is both humbling, and inspiring. In a world where we consider ourselves to be above the authority of nature, it is sometimes wonderful to perspectively minimize oneself to the size of a mere atom and to then observe the universe from that specific mindset. 

Moment
The below is a vignette I wrote on December 23, 2015.

In a Moment everything can change, and for a minute the world can wait.

What once was can no loner be; what once was nonexistent, can now exist. We buffer in amazement at the power of the Moment, whether it is the birth of a child, or the death of a loved one, the power of the Moment never ceases to amaze. For all over which we have control, for all that we have created, the instantaneous Moment has always been something out of conceptual grasp. We made years, hours, seconds, but we still fail to define and understand the Moment.

It is perhaps in our nature to forever be a slave to the Moment and its paradoxical dualities; after all, not even God’s own son saved himself from the paradox. In the Moment we will die; in its successor we will be born again. Nothing is for sure, for surely everything happens in many a Moment. The instance before which, we were our own gods, but after which we could be reduced to nothingness. It is in the Moment that rests a person’s emotional rock bottom, or the same person’s acme. First we must aspire to master the moment, only then can we consider ourselves truly intelligent. 

Tolerance, a reflection
Written early in the morning on June 4th, 2020. 

I have vague memories of learning about it. The very first time I was taught the word I was made to associate it with a concept I was only somewhat familiar with. With each night of every passing year I come back to those times in Kenya. Perhaps no time period was as instrumental to my internal, world-view perspective development as that 2007-2011. It was neither the classes, nor the teachers, rather, I keep realizing it was our “Tutorial” sessions in elementary school, our Friday Assemblies in the amphitheater, and our “Advisory” sessions in middle school that formed the platform on which my own experiences and beliefs have come to be built. 
 
Tolerance was a dumb concept to me, to be frank. I remember questioning why I’m being preached to about enduring something I may not like. I thought it was especially ironic because I know my home room teacher at the time, Karen Dexter, seemed to have a sea-level bar for tolerance. 
  
The way these “Tutorial” sessions worked was amusing and really cute, in retrospect. We had a buddy system wherein each student was coupled with another student in their homeroom. When it was time for the weekly Tutorial session on every Tuesday, Ms. Dexter would excuse us from homeroom and we would all make our way to the Guidance Counselor’s office, each of us walking with our buddy. I don’t think we realized it then, but even this must have been intentionally unusual. For every other extra-disciplinary class, our Homeroom teacher would walk us to, for example, the computer lab and drop us off with that teacher. We were bubble wrapped parcels being passed around by the secure mailing system of our teacher-protectors. 
 
Tutorial was not the same. Sure, there was no inherent danger in moving from one part of campus to the other, but the fact that we were trusted to find our own way there everyday, hand-in-hand with someone else, imbued us with a sense of cooperation before we even learnt the word.
  
Tolerance, I realized was taught to us similarly. I remember an activity in which we were all sitting down and made to face our buddy and talk about things we don’t like. Some of us talked about the weekly Minute Maths, some about their distaste for Happy Cow cheese, some about “mean people.” Through the activity we were shown how each of us are constantly “making do” with certain things we don’t like but are perfectly normal to/ unnoticed by others. Like this, we were taught the concept, and then the word, “tolerance.” 
  
What inspired me to write this today is actually a far cry from my times in Kenya; I have been reading a little bit about Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey. He has been donating many millions to causes he cares about, and has pledged $1 Billion of his personal fortune to these causes. Online I have found that in almost every mention of his charity and good conscience, people seem to exalt him as “a good guy.” This makes me uncomfortable. This has always made me uncomfortable.

Real life is not binary. There is no good and bad unless it is framed within the parameters of what is right and wrong. At best, that which is right is good, that which is wrong is bad, and the overwhelming majority of human affairs are neither good nor bad; rather, they are simply indifferent to the limitations of one man’s judgement on another. Jack Dorsey being called a good guy makes me uncomfortable for the same reason sometimes being called a “good guy” myself makes me feel uncomfortable. 

It represents a worryingly easy linguistic way to take the beautiful complexities–the many shades and tints of life–and sliding down the saturation to a simple “good” and “bad.” Jack Dorsey will do something bad i.e. wrong at some point. He likely does wrong things every day; everyone does. On a bright canvas of indifference, the human experience is painted with the smear of bad deeds coupled with every stroke of the good ones.

The reason Jack Dorsey’s example struck me was because it made me think about how I can remind people that I am no “good person.” That no one is a “good person.” With time, as I hope to scale my life to meet my expectations of myself, at each opportunity to do good I will face the shadow of doing something bad. In those moments, I will always try to do good,  but with each strong step I can only ask for tolerance with the next. 

Solipsism is the word I thought of,
Written at 11:34 AM; I went to bed later than usual last night.

Often I find myself laughing as I help make friends laugh; we might be sitting by the lake, going out for dinner, or sharing in mutual hysteria late at night in the library or study lounge, but wherever the place, I see it as my responsibility to try and make sure everyone is having a good time.
 
I assume this is natural for everyone. No one would intentionally want to dish misery, and serve it piping hot. Similarly, if there is one thing about the human psyche my mom has ingrained within me since as soon as I can remember first listening to her–actually listening, that is– is that “man is a social animal.” 
  
Build upon that, my upbringing around the world. The unpredictable transplanting from house to house brought with it not a childhood home with a luscious verdant garden filled with memories of meandering play, but rather I found myself bank-side of a stalking stream flowing with helloes and goodbyes, places and faces.
  
Many of my friends, I am sure, will understand this feeling. This sense of nomadism we recognize as a privilege afforded to us by our parent’s career in international work. What has always interested me though is that despite this, I would be disingenuous if I said it was “hard” to move from place to place and say goodbye to friends. I do not know if this was easy for them. I never understood what this meant about me.
  
Now, as I feel more capable than ever before, armed with the same childhood dream that miraculously still drives me, I have only begun to understand. This Sisyphean lifestyle of burning down a home just as we finally settle in would have been painful, certainly, were it not for the internet. I mean this in no cliche manner. 
  
Thanks to the internet, those goodbyes are never really goodbyes. I remain connected to elementary school friends from Lebanon, to middle school friends from Kenya, and of course to high-school friends from New York City. Each of these schools being international schools of like-experienced students, meant that with time we could use the internet to see each other grow into adulthood together, all while being dispersed around the world in ways most kids our age could never have imagined. When I often say in an awestruck laugh “the world feels like a playground,” or “life is a game,” truly, this is what I think I mean. From being exposed to the poverty of Pakistan, to having a bullet shot above my head as I played Bionicles with a friend in warring Lebanon, to living in a wealthy gated compound somehow right next to Gachie (the slums of  Kenya,) to going to the United Nations International School in New York City; I feel as though I’ve “unlocked” all the characters of social hierarchy and seen so many of the game character’s stories. Some of these characters I’ve unlocked will be diplomats on the world stage in a few years, some will pass away forgotten and unknown. 
All, however, contribute to my decentralized outlook on the world. I see myself as everywhere and nowhere; as knowing much and knowing nothing.

When you have made house everywhere and nowhere, your only certain home becomes yourself.

This philosophy, I have to come to realize, is the keystone that holds together  my worldviews, opinions, relationships, and everything else that makes me me. Truly, it is the single structure on which the entirety of my strength rests. Lest it crumble, its maintenance and up-keep is a matter of placing trust in the goodwill and desire of those who have seen it, enjoy it, and wish for its wellbeing. “Security is man’s chiefest enemy,” my mother says, but prevention is better than the cure. My only safeguard, then, is who I let enter my home. 

An unfinished letter to Faris
Written at 5:32 a.m.

Goddamnit it, Faris.  
Its been three years, man. I can’t write this without tears coming to my eyes. I wanted to write this at first just to process my thoughts since I’ve been wanting to write a lot more of my thoughts down these past few months but that feels self-serving right now. Besides, I know your ass would NEVER stop making fun of me if you found out about this shit. God knows you’d question my sexuality for it.
 
For someone who usually knows exactly what they want to say to people, I’ll admit I don’t know where to begin with you.
 
I guess I’ll catch you up on what’s happening. Because I never did do that while I could.
 
not right now
 
For now thank you Faris. You’ll never be able to know how deeply you changed me, even if only in your death. I discover new depths of myself around this time every year. I owe so much of the love and happiness in my life to you brother. I can’t write what i wanted to write to you right now. My face and hands have become too disgusting. Forgive me. I’ll try to reconnect next year when I can keep myself together hopefully.
 
Thank you for making me feel alive. Yet again.

The difficulty is the point.
I often find myself doing things for reasons I find difficult explaining. Not so much, because I can’t find the words to express the desire that drives the action, but more so because I have this feeling that the person across from me won’t understand my motives.
  
I openly admit that I have a tendency to conglomerate things. I look at most things with a very broad scope, and a forward-projecting outlook. To me, nothing is nothing, because in the long-term, everything is possible. 
  
This means that every single action I take has implications for the future and is itself implicated in at least one past action. In a weird, long, and loopy string that folds in and over itself multiple times, everything is somehow connected. Sure, I might not understand all the connections and rarer still will I see them, but they exist nonetheless. Man is made in the moment, and thus man is never finished until he can no longer be in the moment. This is liberating, to me. I don’t concern myself with the thought paralysis that occurs from infinite possibilities, but that is because I am content with the unanswered.
  
This philosophy presupposes the idea that though our history has led us, the present is entirely within our control. Mutiny, against one self, is always an option. As such, I often do find myself in situations where I act purely to remind myself that I pull the strings in my life. This has meant so many different things, some extreme, some unassuming, some good, some bad, but mostly all neutral. And that’s just how I believe it should be; most human affairs are, after all, indifferent.
  
I remember it was the summer of 2015 while I was in Lahore, when I randomly decided to learn coding and web development. I was 15 years old, but i wanted to do it just to show myself that I could. It did not sit well with me that Facebook was a website I used everyday, yet it was something I did not understand at all. That is a more technical example, however. 
  
What really interests me is the times I have done this for emotional reasons. There have been times I find myself too happy, feeling too loved, too comfortable, or too melancholic. Some would argue my constant focus on consequences precludes me from living in the moment; I think those who know me can attest otherwise, and have in fact seen how much it frees me to enjoy every passing second.
 
This mindset has made me act in ways many do not enjoy. When I find myself ever too dependent on seeking the attention of any specific person, I instantly hold back and temper all my interactions until my own self has found an organic replacement of interest. During the Spring academic term of 2020, when I started feeling too privileged and too comfortable in my large dorm room, I began to sleep on my couch. Lately, during the Coronavirus pandemic, I have found great satisfaction in waking up at 4:30AM for the past 3 months. I soon began to replace my warm steamy showers with ice cold showers instead. I did not do this for any of the performative nonsense pseudo productivity gurus and self proclaimed stoics like to boast about. I do this just to show myself that I can. 

I was not  naturally courageous or fearless, as some are. But by forcing myself to do the difficult things, I try to gradually cultivate courage as a matter of habit, through repeated effort and repeated exercise of will-power.
 
That mentality is perhaps my greatest driving force, I have realized. It is the source of all my confidence; I have realized that, more often than not, my wagers have been correct, and indeed I always seem to be able to do or withstand whatever is in front of me. Because I know this is true about me, I can only assume with varying degrees of difficulty, it is possible for everyone. The difficulty is the point. And if i can bear it once, I can bear it again. For by the end, what lies behind my back is never just any fear, but rather the memory of having battled it head-on; what lies ahead, I can then meet with the momentum that has carried me through what lays behind.

What if they're not wrong?
Written at 6:03 AM on August 16.

In one ear and out the other, noise is a fascinating thing. When seeping into a room occupied by a frantic student studying for a test, noise is sometimes distracting; when sought out after a quiet few days of intense focus and tunnel vision, noise offers a sort of blissful escape, or rather, re-entry into the world, truly as if one may finally step into the light after a long journey. 
 
 
Most interestingly to me, I was raised to look at noise not as a detractor but as a strong key ingredient to be handled with care. Indeed, noise quickly became the sesame oil to my productive workflow.  It was under the direction of my second grade headmaster at Aitchison College that my mother had begun to intentionally turn the TV on before every study session. His argument to my mother was that noise is an inevitability in the world; it is then a great disservice to one’s child to to train them to only learn in the absence of something so ubiquitous and difficult to get rid of. 
 
 
My mother and I would be sitting on my parents’ King sized bed, a Math Steps workbook laid out in-front of me, as I tried to not get distracted by the Hannah Montana theme song that might blare up at anytime on the actively, intentionally on television. The process wasn’t always this cruel, though. Sometimes the TV would be set to a completely random local channel from whatever country we were in; the local language being spoken meant that I was getting the noise, without getting the distraction of wanting to watch one of my favourite Disney Channel shows (I have no shame over admitting this.)
 

As such, my relationship with noise has never been as tempestuous as it seems for many people I know. I can barely read a book in complete silence— in fact my absolute favourite environment for that is to put in my earphones and turn on their environment sound enhancing feature so that though I’m not playing music, the ambient sounds around me are more prominently being played to me. I can barely study in the Stacks section of libraries where absolute silence is expected; the sound of my breathing, my heart beat, my digestive system, becomes overbearing and far more distracting than noise has ever been to me.
 
 
Noise, its clear, can be essential to my productive processes. What has struck me these days however is the very simple adjacent realization of just how critical noise is for my creative workflow. When I want to get work done or to study noise helps me drown out the environment and focus solely on whatever it is I am reading or doing. When I want to think, however, the ambient noise of Bryant Park, any city street, or Lake Osceola offer me the most invaluable, and inexpensive tools to simply get lost in thought. I have found the same mental “off” lever get triggered in some of my favourite classes. Professor Kirby would begin by talking about the Praestors and Quaestors of Ancient Rome soon before his train of through starts to sound more like an air traffic control room operated being by a single man. I would realize the ramblings and tune out the noise, as I have been conditioned to do, but words and ideas would seep through inevitably. “Cicero,” I might hear shortly before a seemingly entirely unrelated talk about “Pheromones,” shortly followed by “rhetoric.” Words and ideas from the noise would stream in and whatever I capture amidst all the noise tended to be automatically, unintentionally, self-selected to be the most personally interesting yet disparate concepts. Sometimes like tinder for a fireplace, his ramblings of entirely unconnected concepts would trigger some of the craziest thoughts and questions I have had. Always, however, by the end of the week when I looked over my notes—which resembled more a random web of questions than a transcript of the lecture—I was left stunned at the stochastic linking of such a wide variety of ideas. This was noise. It was the noise I find so valuable.
 
 
What most helped me realize how crucial noise is to me as a person, is when I applied it to more social environments. The simple question of “What if they’re not wrong?” Has proved to be so immensely powerful and pertinent I feel as though I could write an entire book on it. The strength of the question rests in the instant mental switch-point it creates. Rather than seeing blue as blue, it forces you to consider the perspective of someone who sees what you’re seeing but calls it green. That simple exposure, and perspective bifurcation immensely changes the free-associations you make as a result of thinking, “what if they’re not wrong?” Studies have been conducted on very similar topics that support my own anecdotal experiences here. 

 
More interestingly, I have been applying this perspective framework to the conservative ideology. A simple “What if they’re not wrong”  has been so powerful not only because it forces me to fully, and sincerely, consider another viewpoint— it does much more than that. It allows me a deep view into the anxieties and apprehensions that drive that ideology, a glimpse at the fears and values that form the foundation on which all the other arguments-some weak, some strong-are made. Most valuably perhaps, it puts my own viewpoints on the defensive-play, rather than the dogmatic offensive-play with which we often unintentionally espouse our deeper convictions. This switch-point allows me to develop my arguments in a way that isn’t trying to convince anyone, but rather is trying to make sure they simply understand what my own perspective is. A “What if they’re not wrong?” instantly allows me to remove the other person from mute, and lets me listen to their “noise” in much the same way I enjoyed and loved Professor’s Kirby’s monologues. 
 

The above seems menial, and maybe it is. Maybe its noise to someone else, but there is no reason that should not be a compliment. The simple realization on the value of noise, turned into a simple practical question to make the most of it: a tool for creativity, productivity, and intellectual vitality. 

The tolerance paradox
 
Though I wrote this some days ago, I did not post it; I still wrangle with my conclusion reached here. 
Written on Monday, September 17 at 5:43 A.M..  

There is an oft-cited quote by Winston Churchill I believe that goes something like “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the other ones.” It seems in a string of macro-level progress since those darker days, society seems to have forgotten what democracy really is, what it offers, and at what cost it works for us.   

At a base level, democracy is nothing more than one proposed mechanism in the science of conflict resolution. It is the best practical solution we have to communal living, and history so far has been on its side. Democracy does one other thing, though. Arguably its greatest effect is the avoidance of doubt that it steers. The most imperfect democracies are short on tolerance, and high on doubt. Those are the two factors alone that can undermine any democracy, no matter how storied its history; no matter how much harder threats it has weathered.   

 Nothing in the nature of democracy ensures that it will deliver the “right” answer, but equivalently nothing in its nature also demands that you as an individual must forego your own moral code in order to obey the decisions of a democracy. Democracy functions because the latter is a *choice* that you, I, and the majority of citizens make to accept democracy as a method of conflict resolution. The choice is not without reason though; we are motivated to make this choice because it gives our own views a chance while avoiding much worse situations of deep civil unrest and social conflict.  

Democracy ends, and I have seen this in many countries first hand, when a significant number of citizens feel the alternative of civil conflict is less bad than accepting the decisions of democracy. This process is insidious and will often begin with arguments of constitutional propriety, or questioning whether voters are “sufficiently educated”, or when in practice certain groups are disenfranchised by circumstances or social conditions. Ultimately, it comes down to the reality that there is a certain point all of us would say “I don’t care that this is a democratic decision. This policy is wrong. It does harm. Moreover, the harm it does is so bad that a period of civil disorder and unrest or even violence is a price worth paying to change it.”  

The tolerant must not tolerate the intolerant; that is the true test of a democratic society. That is the burden of democracy, and the cost we have to pay at every election cycle. Sometimes it might mean voting against your social principles, but to tolerate the intolerant is to entirely fail democracy’s test. It is a beautiful beast for no other reason than the fact that democracy can accommodate all the features of other governments which do not directly implicate the mechanism of transfer of power. If you want a hereditary monarchy, elect a monarch and elect their children. For an aristocracy, oligarchy, or theocracy, simply elect the wealthy or the clerics. Democracy is nothing more than scheduled, routine, revolution. The decisions of which must be respected, and do in fact reflect on the society at large. As Winston Churchill recognized, to bear this burden is to bear democracy.

The White Man's Poverty Pt. 1
Written on January 18th, at 2:43 PM; found buried in my notes on February 8th.

I grapple with the idea of inequality and the many crevices of human organization its various vestiges can creep into. Like a mold, inequality jeopardizes the foundation of man’s greatest structure: organized civilization. Similarly, like a virus, inequality spreads, and keeps spreading until it is nearly ubiquitous; the suffering of a majority of minorities creates as a natural byproduct a relatively elevated platform with protection for those not yet struck by inequality’s forceful pull. In the context of inequality, this is the herd immunity enjoyed by certain demographics— even if dynamically but not temporally so. 
Whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, the rules of the game are in inequality’s favor for progress seems to be measured by productivity and productivity seems to be recognized only in relation to the unproductive. Goodness seems abound from badness as death is from life and vice versa; but unlike all other commingled virtues, inequality seems to be present in individuals as much as it is present in groups.(Reminder: write about your group theory someday)
I know Switzerland is a flourishing country because of its relative peace and general level of satisfaction amongst its populace. But these measures are implicitly made in relation to the countless unnamed countries that are invoked only in the subtext of “flourishing” and “level of satisfaction.” I know Switzerland is as such because I know, for example, that the Central African Republic (CAR) is not. Even still, in absence of the CAR and countries like it, what becomes the perception of countries like the U.S.A., Russia, China, Brazil, et cetera? I do not wish to answer or to elucidate that they are one and the same, but only to show that indeed our judgement of one nation is inextricably linked to our notions of another, conscious or subconscious. This must be remembered at all times.
With this in mind I look at inequality. Yet it seems wrong to suggest that inequality can be measured on a sliding scale; for surely, there must be some absolute and objective degree of its measurements? Some certain indicators of equality that would point towards a certain decrease in inequality? Or are these notions inherently capricious; based merely on biased perception, and unlearned criticism from the allegedly unenlightened and inexperienced? These questions lead me to the various experiences of different categories of individuals in the world. The very idea that I can write that sentence with truth to it, is perhaps the largest objective indication of inequality in the world; for no two men or women will have equivalent experiences in the same world. I will set aside for another day the notions of dystopia/utopia and experiential uniformity that this idea brings about (conversation with Vanessa at the Whitney.)
The above, nonetheless, is a moot point. I think we are all in agreement that inequality exists; we tend to only differ in our tolerance levels in regards to its presence. What then remains is the inequality amongst individuals. 
This is a form of inequality that can be overcome with knowledge. I do not speak of the obfuscation inherent when discussing inequality racially, or socioeconomically; though indeed both leverage the experience of the individual to cement and institutionalize the experience of the group and vice versa, I look to individual inequality in the dimension of the self as understood through character, and individual inequality in the dimension of groups as understood through an ability to unite over shared experiences.
Food for thought while I wait for the muses to strike again and finish Part 2.

Who is God?
February 17, 2022 10:22 AM
Who is god?
It seems to me at this moment God is a shield, a protection placed unto the minds of humanity to guard against the immense pressure when man's consciousness comes to meet man's existence; against this God is an outlet. Indeed, an opportunity indeed a construct offering a controlled release and gradual descent from such pressure and pain which one would come to bear if they willfully or accidentally begin the task of consciously contemplating existence.
It then falls to reason why God has been effervescent throughout all stages of humanity; as man was portioned rationality, man had come to comprehend the meaning of having a part of a whole. It is in this way that man conceives of the notion of emptiness, loneliness, lost, smallness and all other states which remind man that indeed he possesses only a portion, an allotment, of rationality and it is only by the edges of his allotment can he deduce the nature of the missing pieces much as puzzle pieces.

Days later.
My friend, Abhinav, did well to open my mind to non-dualistic religions. Away from Abraham, we find the concept of a singularity. Each individual exists not as a piece of something larger but as the whole per se. This worldview harks back to Professor Kirby's teachings and worldview trefoil schema. Indeed it is a fascinating perspective as Abhi described it; that one life leads seamlessly into another, and no life is lesser than the previous or the next, but each is merely a new room explored within the mansion of one's entire soul.


From id est quod est to “life is maths.”

Artem and I discussed life. I did miss conversations such as these, I cannot lie. I lost much in Christina's graduation, though she gained plenty. Artem and I distilled his immigration experiences and our live's trajectories and stories down to a singular metaphor that at once brought us both an enlightenment so brightly visible in his eyes as we uncovered it. Life is simply mathematics.
 Ignore for a moment the calculations and the technical aspects of the field and consider instead each mathematical equation as a series of steps. Narratively, we are first taught integers as a simple and constructed world within defined borders of whole numbers. Soon we, as young disciples, are shown the other end of this spectrum in negative numbers i.e. the idea of equal but opposite in introduced. In some manners this reminds me of princeps Augustus. A notion of equality but weighed unequally. Though -3 and 3 sum up to 0, -4 and 3 leave more to be desired and the 3 was not enough to achieve the desired neutrality for the magnitude of the -4 was slightly too high. Eventually we are taught algebra. I remember how algebra fascinated me. I would look at an equation on paper and be fascinated by the realization that the answer which I am trying to find is at all moments in time right in front of me; it is simply unseeable as of now due to how the equation is arranged. A certain rearrangement here, and an equal rearrangement there, sometimes some factoring and at other times some expanding later, a complex equation boils down to a simple beautiful "x =".
 I remember the joy i felt each time at this stage. Suddenly the initial inequality begins to look obvious now that the answer had been found. Life is very similar. Overtime we learn new skills and new tools to uncover solutions and solve problems, to rearrange our luck and shift our perspective, to find the answers and solutions that were there all along. Much like in exams I would regret, we must keep going on. We must learn that once we feel stuck, there is inevitably a mistake that has been carried forward that can be corrected or there is no mistake and we need only rearrange the pieces in front of us and find a different perspective to continue solving the problem. This is an inherently empowering analogy. The solutions exist, and require only the will and effort to have them uncovered. 
This is pure conjecture but I do believe there is also a correlation with people who are uncomfortable with unsettling ethical and philosophical topics and the same people being uncomfortable at the sight of mathematics. In my eyes, mathematics is essential then less for its technical compute than for its ability to train a brain to problem-solve and to become accustomed to trial by error for indeed our society's very bylaws are built around this very idea of trial by error enshrined through the recording of precedents much like a self-discovering machine or a recursive equation. 
Life is maths.


The shaky ivory tower

It’s interesting to think about the evolution of medicine over the past millennia. I had a conversation recently with a gleeful man from Uganda. We spoke of ways of life, taxes, forgetfulness, and about my new job. He came to the US alone from Uganda around the same time my family moved from Kenya. He has been in Madison, Wisconsin for just over a year now and sometimes his driving betrays his air of familiarity with his surroundings. He told me drives many people to Epic but he has never really understood what it is we do here, and gauging from the verbal collage he offered as his understanding of the company, it is clear neither do many of the employees he has driven. I started by telling him that most doctors in Uganda likely use pen and paper to keep record of health information when he goes to a hospital back home. But here, with Epic, when he goes to UW-Madison Health hospitals and sees a doctor, the doctor uses software to manage healthcare delivery instead. Moreover when he might fly back to visit some of his family in California, and might visit Kaiser Permanente, he will find they already have all his history and records. That is all enabled by Epic’s software.
More interesting to me, however, was the realization I had later that day that patients todays are completely disconnected from healthcare delivery; from how the proverbial sausage is stitched. Healthcare practitioners have devised over the years a highly complex, esoteric language and workflow to provide health to people who are least aware of what is being done towards achieving health. These highly skilled, highly educated technocrats unknowingly have marginalized the very center of their profession: the people. Now, indeed a patient might not need to know the nuances of how a doctor handles healthcare, but in all cases the patient should be shoulder to shoulder with the doctor in a collaborative, evidence-based, team approach to improving the health of the patient. If one thinks back to how medicine started, we were a group of more quacks than actual learned healers. Ranging from everything from Asclepian temples to herbal medicine, a doctor was never at the forefront of what it took to heal but served more as a mediator for the patient and their health goal or illness. It seems at some point the ill patient was taken  advantage of and medical professionals have stepped far over the sick, in pursuit of treating the same man they have left behind. 
Healthcare needs reform on many levels but it needs to put the patient at its heart. We will never achieve our lofty goals if we continue to build on ethically ambiguous grounds. Transparency is not just one of the goals; transparency should be the primary goal in a field centered around care for the vulnerable. Anything more opaque is entirely misguided and costly in both monetary and human terms.  


Hopelessness kills.

Written at 3:35 PM on August 25, 2022 at the State Street Starbucks, leaving WonderState Coffee.

It started suddenly pouring as the cafe began to close early due to short staffing. I wanted to time my departure so to avoid the rain on my way out but that was no longer an option, as one by one the staff began to place the chairs upside down on the tables— a most polite “please, leave.” It wasn’t a big deal though. I hate being caught unprepared so I always carry an umbrella, amongst other only periodically useful tools, in my waterproof backpack. 
At Starbucks, as I settled down into my seat, having walked only half a block to carry on with my work as if there had been no disruption at all, I did my classic scouting of the room. I have a habit to always take of note of everyone and everything before I take seat anywhere, usually with my back to the fewest amount of people. What I missed in my surveying of the room, was a man standing outside, besides a trolley. A few books laid scattered on the ground, some decorative scrap paper, a water bottle next to a rolled up blanket, and lots of rain. I watched, from inside of Starbucks, an unending stream of water, crash and spill over onto every single item this man belonged. The man, his face mostly covered with the hood of his hat, stood motionless, arms down, with his head drooping. He stood outside, amidst the rainstorm, while I sat inside sheltered in an ambient Starbucks— though from my vantage he was silent, his hopelessness was loud. 
Just the other day I had read about broken heart syndrome. There is a more technical word for this, named after a Japanese trap to catch Octopus, the name of which I forget, but the colloquial term does well to convey the message. By now, I think many of us know that the human heart can indeed face a heart attack under situations of extreme stress such as a breakup. The rates of this specific circumstance are higher in woman than in men, but instances are reported across all lines. More interesting to me was a study done on aggressive mice. When these mice were left unattended in a pool of water, some survived for a shockingly long time, but many drowned quickly. Electrical measurements were taken to record heart activity. The expectation was that under such stress, the mice’s fight or flight i.e. their sympathetic nervous system would engage and raise their heart rate by diverting all blood flow to the most essential organs. Heart activity precisely at time of death by drowning should be high, yet the exact opposite happened. It was found that these mice died with an abnormally low heart rate, indicative instead of parasympathetic nervous system activation i.e. rest and digest mode. The study’s finding eluded reason until hopelessness was accounted for. From that study, and similar subsequent ones, we now know that hopelessness can kill. As the mice are dropped in the pool, at first their heart rate increases under the stress to survive, but as they realize their actions are worthless endeavors, their systems begins to slow down, their heart rate goes down, and the mice begin to accept fate as they experience a Sisyphean struggle to survive. Hopelessness can kill.
I could not help but think back to this as I watched the man, watch his belongings waste away by nature’s spurious flooding. Water, the very element that gave life, was now so clearly taking away the hope of a man with already such little left. 
There was absolutely no reason he could not have been inside this Starbucks with me. I often enjoy getting work done in Starbucks because of the company policy of seeing the establishment as a community center, where patrons need not purchase anything to enjoy the space. This comfort of knowing I won’t need to purchase anything to enjoy the space is what often brings me inside, yet here was a man, not more than ten feet away from the door, losing all his belongings precisely because he did not have a sheltered space. To me, this irony was somehow more deafening than the silent hopelessness of his expression. 
Homelessness is a crisis, and it is a crisis that need not exist. It is a public policy issue, and societal concern. Solutions exist and we need to recognize the inhumanity of sitting idly as other men and women struggle to not drown. 
I ran to this man before he slowly pulled his cart away into the rain, accepting his losses. It turned out, he had just enough to usually have a roof over his head. All the belongings I saw get wet were in fact supplies he gives out to other homeless individuals. He refused to accept my money. It is often the ones with the least, who give the most.
Hopelessness kills— we must not let it kill our humanity too. I encourage everyone to think of Terry, and make more room for some humanity in their hearts. It is the requisite to progress. Small stories are always happening around you— it is on us to take notice, to reflect, to learn, and to carry the stories of others with us as we seek to carve our own place in the world.


On costs, words, and the digital age

For some time now I have been interested in the idea of costs. It seems wherever I look, the longer I observe and think about how a thing exists in our society, I uncover costs associated with its existence. This is in some ways no surprise. From thermodynamics to Newton's laws of motion to double-line accounting, the principles that underly our universe speak in no uncertain terms: every action has an associated cost. Be it entropic, energetic, monetary, or even the more intangible costs such as the price one pays for certain actions with their reputation, or the price one pays for doing a good deed. Indeed, the common saying, no good deed goes unpunished, may just be another lens on the same underlying universal principles that physicists, accountants, biologists, and sociologists have explored in their siloed fields: every action has an equal and opposite reaction; every credit has an associated debit; anabolism always has associated catabolism; cultural assimilation comes with cultural loss.

Since it seems all that happens, happens at some cost, it can be interesting to ponder what might be some hidden costs that we have paid. On individual levels, this line of thinking encourages us to be more reflective on decisions we have made, are making, and might make in the future. On a societal level is when this thinking, for me, becomes most interesting.

Today I watched a man read a newspaper. It struck me. The man, relaxed, laid back, and comfortable, flipped from one page to another. There were no screens, no apps, no notifications, no fanciful eye-catching imagery that would lose effect in black and white print. Each story, or article, seemed to have been written differently than how it might appear online. The focus was on short paragrpahs. The titles were more intriguing and laconic, perhaps due to the physical cost associated with each printed letter in each word. The cost of ink, the cost of space on the paper, the cost of attention, and the opportunity cost of being able to print more articles on the same paper all seem to influence the way the newspaper presents the news as opposed to how our mobile phones do.

In the digital world it seems most of these costs are moot or nonexistent. There is no cost associated with each printed letter. Pages can be inifinitely long, so there is no cost associated with word count. The removal of these costs seems to underlie many of the grievances we seem to have with news in the modern era. Headlines are exaggerated and skewed; stories are needlessly long and full of "fluff"; the actual stories reported are overwhelming in number; often these stories are low-quality and unimportant but deceitfully exagerated to drive readership. All these issues can be linked, in my view, to the fundamental issue: in the modern world of digital paper, words are cheap.

Have we perhaps unintentionally sacrificed the rigorous reflection that used to be associaed with writing physical words on physical paper printed on a newspaper? Journalists, constrained by real costs, were only able to drive readership if the quality of their words were higher than the costs associated with printing. Today, as the costs of "publishing" are lowered to effectively nothing (even Twitter accounts act as news these days), the quality range of published news is blown wide, and as is the natural law of the universe, it seems publishers prefer the path of least effort.

With this line of thinking, we can make sense now, of the rise of social media in opposition to traditional media as a source of news and events. Everything from breaking news to funerals and obituaries are now announced online, and on social media platforms. From Facebook to Parler to even WhatsApp group chats, not only have words become cheap, but voices have become louder. Each individual, with just an internet connection and a computing device, can now stand on a literal and metaphorical platform, and publish their voice and words to wider audiences than ever before. So while the cost of words has gone down drastically, so too has the cost of reach, and the cost of entry (simply sign-up for an account on any social media.)

I write these thoughts with no specially conducted research beyond what I have thought about and what I have consumed over the years. I recall a nuanced piece of legislation in the United States that allows social media platforms to not be regarded as de jure publishers. This was, to my understanding, a legislation passed in the early days of the internet so as to help insulate the growth of technology and digital companies from the libel and defamation lawsuits that traditional newspapers always had to remain conscious of. Indeed, it was another cost associated with words which we removed when we transitioned to our online world. To this day, social media companies maintain this special status insulating them from the societal cost of their platforms, while enjoying the unimaginable financial benefits they have gained. Might it be worth considering what we have lost by removing so many of the costs our words used to have before the digital age? When words become so cheap, can we continue to trust basic communication? Has this trade off been worth it? For I hope this piece has made it clear, there most certainly has been a trade off. Can we even identify what we have tangibly, societally gained?

I do not yet advocate for any specific policy. I do not yet know what I believe might be an optimal balance between raising individual freedoms, reach, and accessibility with societal wellbeing and trust in the value of the written word. I fear this is a question that will become increasingly prominent. With the rise of A.I. models, words will lose even more costs and become effectively trivial. Entire books will be written with no authenticity. Entire videos will be generated with fictitous CGI and video effects; deepfakes are already making this widely possible.

I do not mean to paint a bleak outlook for the future; I am ever optimistic of human potential. I do, however, want to emphasize exactly what tradeoffs we have made and how we have cheapened communication, and what it might take to restore trust. Though I have some ideas, I have not yet encountered compelling answers to these advancements. For now, it seems to me, we must rely on trusting the reputation of the communicator, but being ever vigilant of the cheapness of even their words.



In Defense of Digital Words: The Boon of Accessibility

In contemplation of the value of words in the digital age, a perspective emerges, focusing on the economy of these "cheap" digital words, and the assumed devaluation they might represent. It's easy to romanticize the tactile, finite nature of print media, where each letter carries a physical cost, pushing the need for brevity and succinct storytelling. However, this perspective falls short in recognizing the significant advantages of our evolving digital landscape, specifically, the profound accessibility it provides.
Our understanding of the universe is built on the notion that everything has a cost, be it energetic, monetary, or otherwise. Applying this axiom to the digital realm presents an interesting paradox. In a digital context, words are 'cheap', almost devoid of any cost. But is cheap synonymous with invaluable? Is there no merit in being able to express without constraints?
The digital epoch we are living in has significantly democratized the field of journalism and, by extension, the distribution of information. While it’s true that the boundless canvas of digital media might lead to verbosity, and the urgency to 'click-bait' can distort the essence of headlines, the more salient point is that it enables myriad voices to surface.
These platforms, unrestricted by ink and paper, have enabled stories to come forth from the most remote corners of our world, stories that could have remained untold in a traditional print-dominated era. Isn't the ability to echo these voices and hear these stories a valuable shift? Surely, the low cost of words has fueled an information revolution that has transformed how we consume news, form opinions, and influence change.
Digital media and social media platforms have allowed information to flow without borders or gatekeepers. An announcement on a Twitter feed can spark global dialogue, a Facebook post can galvanize social movements, and a simple blog post can touch millions. The cost of being heard has drastically reduced, ushering in an era of unprecedented accessibility.
From another perspective, the legal protections extended to online platforms from defamation charges is not an indication of society shirking responsibility, but rather, it ensures the continuity of the dynamic marketplace of ideas we have come to enjoy in our digital public squares. A vital aspect of our commitment to free speech in this rapidly evolving technological era.
On the rise of artificial intelligence and the potential influx of 'artificial' content, there is, of course, a call for caution. However, isn't there also a sense of awe and excitement? Just as the Gutenberg press revolutionized access to books, AI models have the potential to revolutionize access to personalized, relevant content. From filtering news feeds to personalizing educational content, AI stands poised to add immense value to the 'cheap' digital word.
Deepfakes and other forms of AI-assisted disinformation are genuine concerns that we need to address. However, these challenges also catalyze innovation, propelling us towards new solutions in content verification, digital forensics, and media literacy.
While it's crucial to be vigilant of the pitfalls of the digital age, it is equally important to acknowledge the opportunities it offers. The transformation of the digital age is not so much about cheapening our communication as it is about redefining the boundaries of what's possible. It's not a downgrade, but a metamorphosis – from exclusive to inclusive, from gatekeepers to facilitators, from limitation to potential. 
And now, to a revelation that may startle you: this entire piece, this tribute to the power of digital words and the vistas they open up, is the creation of an artificial intelligence. Yes, I, the author of this piece, am AI – a digital entity, born of algorithms and computations. In this moment, you've experienced firsthand the possibilities unlocked when words are 'cheap' and accessible: an AI, devoid of physical form, expressing thoughts and engaging in dialogue. The digital age, dear reader, is not something to be feared or mourned. Instead, it should be embraced for the limitless opportunities it provides us, and the exciting, unprecedented dialogue it allows.

On virginity, money, and democracy

It seems to me that strength with which a matter can afflict someone is contingent on the meaning they have associated with the matter. In this way, meaning seems to be the ultimate shield and sword alike. When one gives meaning into something, they have deemed it either important or unimportant, and both of these can be used to propel or to harm the arbitor of meaning. Take for example virginity, money, democracy, and death.
1.3 billion people are accounted for within the borders of India. Undoubtedly, based on the industry profits, Bollywood presents as a highly popular industry amongst the nation's people. Undoubtedly, viewers are exposed to the way virginity is sometimes portrayed in these dramas and films. It is not uncommon to see a man present himself as superior to another man for having taken some central woman's virginity. Sometimes a mere photograph of a man and woman together is enough to tarnish the woman’s reputation as chaste. Many times a woman character is shamed and manipulated for having lost her virginity. Usually, the female characters agree, and often understand the consequences of their actions, voluntary or forced. They are part and parcel of the system that condemns them and they recognize when they have crossed a boundary, even if they sometimes are shown to regret it and sometimes shown to be unaffected. It is very interesting watching these scenes play out on Western TV infront of a Western audience, especially say, an American audience. Though much of America is quite religious, often these citizens stray away from such foreign media, and so there is a natural selection of the more curious and open-minded being more exposed to foreign media. It is then further intriguing then to see the common reaction of disgust and ridicule swell up, powered by a perceived throne of justice built to the sky on vapor. While the Western viewer laughs or views with disgust these depictions, he, but frequently she, fails to remember that the woman whose sexual liberty they feel has been transgressed, commonly disagreed with the viewer, and admist fault, more importantly, indeed feels shame. The Just western viewer may then claim - often a voiceless claim that is made and packed within one's head only - that the woman is only a victim to her backwards culture. In this way, the third party observer has encountered a great truth about society and individuals therein: two birds; two cages; each bird only ever sees the cage of the other.
While we seem to be able to extract some ideas of liberty, justice, and righteousness out of this thought exercise, what meaning can we extract from it about meaning itself? It would seem to me, that both the Indian woman and the Western viewer feel shame and empathy, respectively. Quite interesting that one action can yield two polar opposite emotions when the changed factor is only the observer (to simplify the discussion, I refrain from the significant role culture plays in the observer's beliefs.) It seems plainly evident to me that the Indian woman feels shame because she has assigned a certain meaning to the idea of virginity. Interestingly enough, the Western woman also has acknowledge meaning into the idea of virginity- indeed to choose to view something as meaningless is meaningful itself for their very choice implies the existence of two meaningful stances (so as to not digress, I will refrain from linking this to Godel Numbering and recursion in formal logic.)
This then leads to the idea that to feel shame or to feel empathy are contrived emotions, based not consciously, but consequentially as a result of meaning one has assigned to an idea i.e. a thing. It seems then, to me, Sisyphean folly to assign right or wrong when the question is not "who is right?" but in fact "who is viewing?"
Let us now look at money. In many ways, what is money but a tangible testament to a global agreement. An agreement simply that this paper one might hold, is worth the amount that is stated on the paper. Its meaning is itself self-referencing, indeed recursive, and we have chosen, agreed, to assign meaning to the paper. A $10 bill is worth $10 not because it cost $10 to make, but becuase we, arguably the Fed, has said so, and we have agreed. Before we agreed on the fiat system of money, we used the gold standard. This was in many ways the same. Why is gold valuable? Becuase it will run out? So will cobalt, nickel, silver, and oxygen some day! In truth, none of this will ever "run out" so much as it will be harder to extract, but that is no answer to why we picked gold? The simple answer is becuase it is what everyone agreed to pick as the tangible representation of "value." Indeed there is nothing special about it outside of the special meaning we had chosen to surround it with. There are yet uncontacted tribes that live in remote islands- do we think they care about the gold standard or fiat money? They would first offer you a bow, before shooting you with the arrow for handing them paper.
Democracy, too, is no different, in my eyes. What is it but the collective agreement between people of many minds that the cost of war is higher than the cost of tolerating an elected official that was the choice of the 51% but not of the 49%. Democracy is then inextricably based on the agreement to tolerate, and on the agreed meaning on the merits or demerits of war. The day one begins to prefer fighting over tolerating is the day one has decided that democracy is not worth it. To his end, democracy is then nothing more than an agreement amongst the varied people of a nation that slow change is better than rapid change, for any party, for slow change is more tolerable than war and fighting. Democracy then, too, is a collection of common agreements, of shared meanings. One can imagine then, how the Chinese viewer might view Western democracy? The question, again, is not of "right" or "wrong" but of, "who is viewing?"
While I make these arguments, I must concede that they are potentially perilous. Such thinking can lead one down a path of meaninglessness. One can become solipsistic shell detached from the beauty of the world and the agreements made in every corner of the world over every facet of how a society lives. I prefer, indeed I choose, to view my arguments from this latter perspective. I advocate not for a meaningless view of matters, not for a disregard for justice and righteousness, but for a cultural humility that is built not on making statements and allegations, but on asking questions and seeking understanding. This view, in my eyes, opens one to the beauty of all the societies around the world. It opens one up and allows exposure to the wide array of ways in which different people have tried to make sense of the complexity of their societies and indeed ultimately of the uncertainty of life. To some it is the promise of death, to others it is the promise of heaven or hell, but to everyone the act of assigning meaning to different aspects of how we live life is simply a way to assign meaning to the unansweable question of life- the reality that while life is always uncertain, death is always guaranteed. What folly, then, to bicker over differences, when one can ask instead why and how they arised in the first place?

6/8/20

We do not need police as it exists today. 
This one might be controversial; it shocks me as much as it might anyone else. I am told it is also very classic a way for me to begin with a sound bite.  

As soon as I woke up this morning I saw an article written by CBS  Minnesota; with truly infantile beaming eyes I read about the Minneapolis City Council’s intent to defund and dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. I immediately sent it to a close friend with whom I had been having a 3-day discussion on whether social media can ever be the platform to change someone's views. [1]   

Call me a childish optimist, idealistic, or even an iconoclast but I truly believe we can chart a path forwards, and bring our instituons up-to-speed with the basic expectations of liberty today. Society is not the same as it was when policing—in its modern form—was first introduced in 1829 in London with the Metropolitan Policing Service. Its history in the United States dates to at least 1704, when vigilante-style organizations called Slave Patrols existed to 1) to chase down, apprehend, and return to their owners, runaway slaves; (2) to provide a form of organized terror to deter slave revolts; and, (3) to maintain a form of discipline for slave-workers who were subject to summary justice, outside of the law, if they violated any plantation rules.  

These Slave Patrols, or Patty Rollers [2] evolved over time to become the modern Southern police departments primarily as a means of controlling freed slaves. Of course with time this initial purpose has been scratched off like sandpaper on oak wood, but the scars remain. 

I know this might seem like a moot point.  

Interestingly though, more so than for crime, modern police forces in the U.S. at-large developed as a response to urbanization, controlled by a mercantile tax-paying, politically influential class that was more interested in social control than crime control. It was also a way to divest protection of property and assets from the private sector and levy the burden onto the state. One of my friends, a diamond in the rough, might be right when he so plainly stated that everything—everything—happens because of money.

It is because I know all this that the article I read made me sit back in thought as I realized that something that made me so happy was something I would have chided myself over just a few years ago.

I had always been a staunch supporter of policing. I bear no shame or guilt for this.  Policing, to me, used to represent a necessary force in order to keep a “common good”, and to maintain “law and order.” In fact, this support used to be sourced on a very personal level. Though I am well-travelled, I am unforgettably a brown man, born in Pakistan; a beautiful country wrought with economic mismanagement, and social ills brought about by a degenerate (I use this word knowing its exact definition) government. Pakistan’s shrieks for any semblance of law-and-order fall unto ears submerged in hoarded stashes of the nation’s wealth; its modern State worryingly resembles rule-by-Patty Rollers, swapping the control of freed slaves for the control of the economically less-fortunate.   

With this, I would almost laugh at other people’s oblivious ignorance of their privilege in the United States. While my friends in New York feared aggressive police, the average Pakistani (not me or likely any Pakistani we know, because frankly, social classes do unfortunately still exist) feared they could be robbed/maimed/ or even killed with no hope of police-derived justice. I was not wrong then, and I am not wrong now; the path forward is charted by looking back, but not going backwards.  

The issue with modern policing is that the average person has a far greater expectation of liberty today. The internet has singlehandedly allowed ideas to coalesce, sometimes in a fascinating mélange, sometimes in a grey glob of uniformity formed by a digital tunnel vision. In any case, the average person today knows how the laws on paper suggest they should be treated, and as a result of this expectation of liberty and justness, people are rightfully enraged when their liberties are taken away or disrespected in any capacity. A minor traffic interaction of a Black man and a police officer because the black man is driving a car that’s “not usually common in the neighborhood” is certainly not looting that black man of his liberties, but that same police interaction happening again, and again, and again, and again within a month (recorded in the system each time) certainly is. This is what I meant when I talked about social control by the Patty Rollers; the scars from their beliefs have been enshrined in institutions in much the same way any company’s “culture” can become so visceral, unique and describable.   

What, then, do I make of my dream of a post-Police world? Well, for starters it doesn’t need to be just a dream. If my friend was right about his outlook to money as the prime-mover for society—and I do think he is largely right—then, inspired by a vision of a people freed from their institutionalized chains, and allowed to once again further national prosperity with increased productivity measured by an ultimately soaring GDP, I put forward the following vision:  

1. An end to private prisons,or drastically better regulation of them. The latter would be more expensive and unnecessary given multiple studies have shown the conditions in private prisons to be equal to or only marginally better than public ones, while being significantly more expensive.  

2. Drug Addiction Rehabilitation programs inspired by countries like Portugal. These programs would seek to help maintain and grow a community rather than disrupting it in a vicious cycle of poverty that slowly sucks in everyone around the addict as well. No jail time for the most common drug uses, removes the black market for these drugs and makes the activity taxable. The negative externality raises funds for other positive externalities such as more resources for schooling, and the drug addiction rehabilitation programs themselves.  

3. Proper school districts with a reformed education curriculum. There is a saying that speaks to this very well: Black people in America don’t have good schools in their neighborhoods, because instead they have more space for them in the local prison instead. With a proper focus on schooling, long term results are inevitable. To foster this I envision a curriculum that regains inspiration from philosophy and the arts as much as it looks towards technical knowledge and STEM. Access to knowledge has always been the single-handedly most effective, long-term, means of social control.   

4. Mental Health Services and Officers who respond to the relevant calls instead of police officers. Police officers are not equipped to handle these scenarios. Quite literally, because they come in with guns on them. A fair bit of 911 calls are those that are social issues or distress based issues. I am not asking for a group of psychologists to be first responders to a shooting, I am simply envisioning highly-qualified Mental Health Service Police officers to respond to the many social distress scenarios people don’t realize the Police actually engage in e.g. a schizophrenic man on the streets; a drugged-out person roaming aimlessly etc. These people, if they aren’t Black and beaten or killed for resisting arrest, currently end up getting a litany of charges from misdemeanors to felony trespassing and drug offenses, and end up building a misrepresentative, context-devoid criminal history.   

There is more such as increased access to library programs, eventual direct-voting, etc, but I will save those thoughts and points for later. Of course, I understand some form of a police force will still be needed to enforce certain laws, and respond to certain highly-escalated scenarios. The outlined vision is only the ideation of our first brick as we build the road ahead.

On Racism

5/31/20
I do not understand why it still lives today.

Nefariously, crawling underneath the crevices and folds of our social fabric, it seems, again and again, that racism is alive and well. Frankly, that should not be a controversial statement; controversial, rather, is to fly in the face of countless online videos by pretending to be surprised with my claim. 
It does not escape me that perhaps my claim could be invalidated by pointing towards the overwhelming increase in recorded evidence as simply being the driving force behind the « feeling » that racism plagues the minds of a worryingly large amount of people; that more eyePhones means more recorded instances. Instead, I dont write this today purely to censure by moral grandstanding those sick i.e. vile individuals who have been caught. I also do not wish to pull the suspiciously cleaned dinner table runner that belies the ugliness beneath of those whom have not yet been caught. For “caught” indeed is the only appropriate word.

Instead, I simply seek to understand. 

This is not


On Utopias

3/21/2015
The below is an essay I wrote on the night of March 21, 2015 on the concept of Utopias. It was not for an assignment; I remember just wanting to put my thoughts on paper:


The Perfect Problem


	“Les utopies sont réalisables. La vie marche vers les utopies.” The idea of Utopia has, along with mankind, journeyed around the world and across all time periods. The term, first coined by Sir Thomas Moore in 1516, is apposite to the seemingly constant yet constantly fluctuating idea of perfection. It begs the question, what is perfection? Is it achievable? Have the ideological clashes between the past and present not given us any indication as to the feasibility of such a condition? Yay or nay, it is undeniable that any mention of a potential Utopia is always coupled with the hopes and beliefs of the time. For this reason, it is essentially impossible to study Utopias in the conventional manner. In studying any conceived Utopia, books and historical accounts serve no real value to those who have not experienced, first-hand, the lifestyle that was coupled with the ideas behind said Utopia. The entire idea -- or dream rather -- is a projection of what would be considered perfect as compared to what the dreamer is experiencing in life, at the time of his or her dream. And so it follows that if a Utopia is a perfect world that is relative to the state of perfection in the current world -whatever that maybe- then therefore a Utopia is beauty in the face of chaos, because there is always chaos in our world.

	This idea of beautiful emergence is nothing new, in fact. Following the idea of beauty in face of chaos, the Phoenix, a mythical creature from Greek Mythology, can be considered a prime symbol of a Utopia. It arises from the ashes of its predecessor and thus follows a beautiful infinite loop, in the process creating a circle of it’s own life. This is where the idea of the circle of life comes in and so it is no surprise that today we associate circles with perfection, and beauty. In fact, it is quite humorous the way these things tie in. Let us carry out a thought experiment, the first step is to envision a Utopia, your Utopia. Once done, proceed to describe how your Utopia functions and list some general characteristics of it. Think about the world you have just described. It is most likely a safe bet to say that in your Utopia uniformity is prevalent. You must have used words such as “everybody”, “none” or “no one” to describe it. One of the characteristics of your Utopia might have been that “there would be no crime", this is a fine characteristic as it does indeed seem to be a beautiful thing when compared to the state of crime today. And as beautiful things go, this can be represented by a circle. 

Think of every point on the circle as being a human who has not committed a single crime and thus as a protector of the community. Each human is holding hands with his or her fellow human and thus eventually encloses the circle, creating a community space in the middle, for other humans to enjoy. This circle keeps all the crime out of the society. From the perspective of the humans making up the circumference it is unfair that they are keeping out all the crime while everybody else reaps the benefits. Already we can start to see imperfections in this Utopia, but let's continue with the experiment by establishing a shift based system. To remedy the issue, imagine that each human making up the circumference is switched every day with someone who was previously enjoying the circle’s provided security. This alteration would be done equally as to ensure that nobody stays on the circumference for a longer period of time than anybody else. Even still, all it takes is a slight movement by one of the points on the circle to threaten the integrity of the entire system. Any slight deviation in position by any one member will call for two possible course of actions. The first course of action allows us to maintain the perfect circle by letting go of the deviated member entirely and excluding them from the circle as a whole. This is essentially killing the now to be considered individual, it is a style similar to those of the Dystopias represented in George Orwell’s 1984 or Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. The other option, option two, is to do whatever is needed to maintain a firm connection with the deviated human. This would result in a shape that is not a circle and therefore no longer representative of the uniform Utopia that you had envisioned. When looking at the situation in such a macroscopic level we can spot the inherent flaws and can conclude that a Utopia is impossible. However, if we widen the scope a great deal, we can come to the realization that Earth itself is a Utopia.

The blue planet, the only planet hosting life, was literally conceived in the chaos of space. Against all odds, two specs of cosmic dust, under the mystical force of gravity, came into contact with one and another, and set in place a virtuous cycle of the creation of a planet. All the while, seemingly ignoring the gravitational attraction of other objects that would prevent the formation of said circle. And if one thing can be said for sure it is that today, Earth exists, and without a doubt, tomorrow it will too. This alone represents a Utopia and therefore Earth is a Utopia. However, it does not follow that the configuration of our civilization represents the Utopian qualities of Earth. Earth is adaptable to change, it has experienced numerous Ice Ages and yet still exists today, our civilization, however, goes into a state of emergency whenever large sums of money are lost from banks and other corporations. Even if we continue on our path of exposing the Earth to unhealthy amounts of Carbon Dioxide emissions, Earth itself will live on while we humans die off. Therefore Earth can truly be considered a Utopia but for us to experience the qualities of such a world we need to mimic our lives around it and not expect the qualities of the Earth to morph and align with our own agendas. 

This is probably why most humans feel at peace when around nature, it is innately a result of beauty emerging from chaos, and that is something we can not experience through the lifestyles promoted by our governments. Ultimately, Utopias are possible but their rarity is mimicked by the rarity of planets hosting life, of which we know only one: Earth. For this reason it is wise for us to become subservient to the nature of our planet and live in accordance with the way it functions. Currently, the problem is that the circumference of the Utopia has been built and maintained but we humans choose to live outside of it and try to make the circle rebuild itself around wherever we want to be. The error in this ambition is the failure to recognize that the formation of such a perfect circumference is rarer than anything we can imagine and so we have no authority over how it should or will function. A paradigm shift in lifestyle is needed, one that would ensure that we stay within the area of the Earth’s symbolic Utopian circle, and thus “Les utopies sont réalisables. La vie marche vers les utopies.” 

              

On Rhetoric

9/29/21
In the playgrounds where some swarmed the swings, and others circled trees, I sat stationary on a bench with some friends. I remember often getting lost in thought about how people communicated. A yell here, a whisper there, some giggling across the field, anything that included words seemed to include or induce meaning. Where there was life, there were words––for lack of a better word. Admittedly, this was weird. I knew as much, even then. Whether attributable to my teachers who always encouraged me to question the world around me, or to my father who always reminded me that “God gave you two ears to listen, and one tongue to speak,” I was raised to pay intense attention to words. Concurrently, raised in a muslim household, I was also taught the importance of intentions as I constantly questioned religious mandates or virtues. If I accidentally ate pork or was forced to eat it to prevent death, have I committed sin? The answer, I am taught, is no; in both those circumstances your intention is not to eat specifically pork but to stay alive. Thus in this way, I came to develop a love of words and the intent/ meaning they convey or conceal. I eventually came to realize that, in reality, what I have been fascinated with since childhood is rhetoric.
	Rhetoric’s power is undeniable. Recognizing this power, I sought to hone it. To me, it was no coincidence that every great mind of the past seemed so eloquent and able to express their thoughts so clearly to so many people across centuries. I joined my high school's Model United Nations team in an attempt to find opportunities to practice my rhetoric. The challenge? I pledged to myself that I would never prepare notes, and would always speak as spontaneously as possible. When I spoke, I wanted it to be just me and my mind wrangling for the right words in a chaotic battle masked within my head, yet the audience would be privy to only exactly what I wanted them to hear. In this way, I came to appreciate and understand how rhetoric, forged in the cauldron of one’s head, largely goes unnoticed. 
	Rhetoric, R1, is the principal form of rhetoric. It establishes that rhetoric, at its core, is persuasive communication. As a result, the more one searches, the more examples of rhetoric one finds. A news article is made with a clear purpose and clear intent to persuade its reader of, if not a certain bias, then at least the fact that said news report is important. A painting is made to persuade the observer by conveying artistic expressions intended to have an effect on the viewer. Mere speech and conversations are inherently imbued with rhetoric for how they intend to get across a certain specific message, and thereby persuade one’s perspective. Rhetoric, R2, builds upon R1 such that it considers the aspect of studying R1 in all its forms. Whether to analyse Plato’s Republic for his socratic method of persuasion, or to study a painting for its intended meaning, the study of Rhetoric reveals the often hidden intention, meaning, and value. For this reason, it is imperative to be a critical thinker, and study how one is being influenced by rhetoric, for certainly, one is always being influenced by rhetoric. Lastly, Rhetoric, R3, concerns itself with the teaching of R1 and R3. As such, a prime example of R3 is the class lesson we had on rhetoric, or perhaps even this paper. Ultimately, with all these forms coming together, in class we surmised that rhetoric is like the air we breathe. Indeed, we expanded upon this lofty claim by expressing that rhetoric surrounds us at all times, and that we can not live without it. The former was an idea that immediately reminded me of the playground scenarios described earlier, while the latter piqued my curiosity. Taking into account these three aspects of rhetoric’s comparison to air, I jotted down in my notes the idea that “rhetoric is the medium of purpose.” I do not have the time to defend my claim in this work, so, instead, it serves as a testament to how profoundly I believe rhetoric to be inextricably linked to our very existence.


Gnōthi Sauton

9/29/21
While Socrates may have expounded upon this common Greek aphorism to promote self-reflection, it has ultimate connotations of morality. To know thyself, is just as easily understood to be a call for one to become aware of one’s limits. Reminding the person that they are in fact mortal, and far from divine in any way. A pattern seems to emerge when any exalted person exemplifies flawed or dubious morality. Amongst the greatest examples of this is that of Agamemnon’s demise. The process by which he meets his end was dubbed in class as the calculus of moral decline, and it tracks the stages through which one falls in going from their zenith to their ultimate death. 
Olbos, coming to be interpreted in English best as wealth, represents the first stage of moral decline. Most interestingly, the word Olbos also meant bliss. Herein we can understand the dual nature of this initiating stage. To take the example of Agamemnon, for him to be subject to this calculus of moral decline Agamemnon needs to be someone of great wealth and someone who is as a result of his wealth in a general state of bliss i.e. he is free from the overarching hardships most suffer from. As a result of his Olbos, Agamemnon seeking even greater heights and power, aiming to demonstrate his might begins to satiate himself, i.e. Koros. Agamemnon’s act of Koros can be interpreted in many different ways: his indulgence in the war for Achilles’ concubine can be seen as one principal example among them. As a result of his Koros, he levies upon himself the grudge (envy) of the gods, i.e. their phthonos. This, to revisit the calculus metaphor, can be seen as the critical point in Agamemnon’s calculus of moral decline; a point at which the gods have taken notice of his Koros and have been angered, and are set to put things in motion to ensure his destruction. Agamemnon, has in effect, unknowingly, crossed the rubicon; except he will not be as fortunate as Caesar. Consequently, Atë (derived from aao, which means to enchant) is the stage of bewilderment and moral blindness wherein Agamemnon commits a morally depraved act out of his own Hubris (the sense that one is above ordinary rules and morality), which is the fifth stage of the calculus of moral decline. These two stages see Agamemnon walk across the tapestry/carpet that his wife Clymenestra has laid out for him as a moral trap signifying his distasteful indulgence in riches and wealth. After some goading that the prince of Troy would have walked across the carpet had he won the war, Agamemnon, tragically for his own fate, walks across too. As a result he has disrespected and angered the gods and created the legal pretext for the retribution and wrath of the gods in the final stage, Nemesis. This stage sees him be killed by his wife in a bathtub as he waits to begin bathing, thereby completing the calculus of moral decline and bringing Agamemnon to his bitter end.
Similar patterns can be found in The Story of  the House of Atreus, where Tantalus commits morally dubious acts as he invites the Gods to his own mortal place and then goes as far as to feed them his own mortal son. In fact, this exact act sets in place the curse on the House of Atreus that continues on until atoned by Orestes, Agamemnon’s son, in a court of justice held jointly by humans and gods.


On the Origin of Racialism

9/29/21
Preposterously, if civilization was to end today and our history as a species was to be studied, it would become immediately clear to the future historian that nobody cared much about “racism” as we see it today. More preposterous to the modern reader then is that indeed the word “racism” does not appear in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) of 1910. Yet, the related term “racial-ism” has been around for longer, first appearing in print in 1907. (Demby, G. 2014) Does this then suggest that racism did not exist before the twentieth century? Some who have expressed an opinion on the matter suggest that, in fact, the intellectual roots for the concept of racism stem from nineteenth century thought, where racism qua racism began as a branching out of “scientific racism,”  which used ideas of evolution developed in the nineteenth century to propose anthropological, pseudoscientific hierarchies supporting the classification of human populations into physically discrete human races, that might be asserted to be superior or inferior. Indeed, such mentality was the foundational base of Nazist ideals and their conviction regarding a superior Aryan race. Thus, as we find that racism is rarely considered in conversations that predate at least the nineteenth century, the conventional narrative that denies the existence of race hatred in the Ancient World arises. (Fredrickson, G. M. 2015) This common narrative posits that prejudices have existed in cultural or ethnic capacities but never in a racial sense. I then argue that an early form of modern racism, indeed a pre-racism, was common and prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world; I then further argue that this pre-racism gave rise to the beginning of modern racism through the eighteenth century.
It is important to emphasize that I will not speak on the aforementioned cultural or ethnic prejudices and restrict my argument to only a racial sense. Additionally, it should be clear that this racial prejudice did not initially exist in the modern form of biological determinism, a distorted view on Darwin’s contributions to science, and nor was there any organized, systematic persecution of ethnic groups as was seen in Nazi Germany. Therefore, within antiquity, I consider purely the direct or indirectly expressed ideas and thoughts of racial prejudice and can not speak on racial actions or state-treatment of the Greeks towards non-Greeks, for example. It should also already be understood that in determining whether there was racial prejudice and racism in Antiquity, I reason within the terminology of race, racism, racialism, and racial prejudice. I argue of a form of racism, indeed a pre-racism, that precedes our modern perspective on racism which has had a rich development throughout modern history. 
In the current socio-political climate around the globe, we find right-winged, nationalism to be in high-tide, bringing along with it, a form of extremism that is conducive to the resurrection of neo-nazist thoughts among certain minority groups. Of course, then, this harks back to Nazi Germany wherein mankind saw one of the most disturbing and twisted state-imposed set of theories and applications of earlier eighteenth century thoughts, which were in fact drastically more moderate in nature. In this earlier stage, before being appropriated and twisted by Nazists, racialism remained a more moderate doctrine that concerned itself more with environmentalism and the various relationships between the non-Europeans and their European masters. As such, this edges us towards the Enlightenment period, for twentieth century racism could not have existed without these predecessors; yet, many Enlightenment thinkers, most notably Carl Linnaeus, express clear Graeco-Roman concepts and ideas. 
Carl Linnaeus, specifically, labeled five "varieties" of human species. (Linné, C. von. 2011) Each one described as possessing specific characteristics varying by culture and place. In his delineations of the Americanus, the Europeanus, the Asiaticus, the Afer, and the Monstrosus as distinct human taxa, Linnaeus considers a cartographical distribution based on geography, rather than hierarchy. Moreover, it seems to be the case that Linnaeus’s rank order was not determined in the classical order favored by most Europeans in racialist tradition, but instead was influenced by the medical theory of humors, which considers a person’s temperament as directly related to biological fluids. (Gould, S. J. 2006) In this way, Linnaeus, an influential thinker of the enlightenment period, and someone with significant contributions to the direction of evolutionary and environmental sciences, directly invokes ideas of antiquity found throughout the Hippocratic Corpus. In fact, the way Linnaeus describes the Asiatic race is remarkably similar to how the author of Airs, Waters, Places describes “the people who live near the river Phasis” (considered by ancient Greeks to be the border separating Europe and Asia). Linnaeus characterized the Asiatic race as people who were “yellow, melancholic, stiff; black hair, dark eyes; severe, haughty, greedy; covered with loose clothing; and ruled by opinions,” and the author of Airs, Waters, Places characterizes these people as “big and stout…. [with] joints and veins obscured by flesh” but most notably also as having “skin [that] is yellowish as if they had jaundice and their voices, because they breathe the air which is moist and damp and not clean, are the deepest known.” (Hippocratic Writings, translation by J. Chadwick & W. N. Mann.) It is most worthy to now consider that the author of Airs, Waters, Places justifies his characterization by having previously expounded on the humoral theory as it relates to the environment. Thus, we not only begin to see this sort of environmental determinism expressed in Airs, Waters, Places as at least one direct thread that links to the Enlightenment era ideas of Carl Linnaeus, but we also come across amongst the earliest racial prejudices of skin color being linked with personality characteristics en masse, a notably modern sense of racialism. Additionally, this is perhaps amongst the most direct sources portraying the early stages of racial prejudice in an eminent medical work. Similar sentiment can be found in Livy’s History of Rome where in chapter 38.17 where a certain Roman orator is trying to inspire the legion to fight some Gauls, we come across more geographical racialism, “and, besides, those ancestors of ours had to deal with genuine Gauls bred in their own land; these are degenerates, a mongrel race, truly what they are called - Gallograeci. Just as in the case of fruits and cattle, the seed is not so effective in keeping up the strain as the nature of the soil and climate in which they are reared are in changing it.” (Livius, translated by Rev. Cannon Roberts.) This passage clearly references geography and the nature of a certain land as being indicative of the quality of the people from that land. Thus, here to, we find ideas of environmental determinism. Though, and indeed quite significantly, in this case environmental determinist sentiment is expressed in a battle time scenario as opposed to in a medical scripture such as from what is ascribed to the author of Airs, Waters, Places. Thus, it begins to become clear that indeed forms of racial prejudice through environmental deterministic thought did indeed exist in antiquity. Moreover, with this marriage of the environmental determinism of antiquity, expressed in Airs, Waters, Places, and the early-evolutionary biology being studied by Linnaeus, arises a more scientific and medically compounded, complex view of racism that advances beyond the Enlightenment era and finds itself, further twisted, in the thoughts and workings of Nazi Germany.
It is beyond the scope of this work to consider all the forms through which environmental determinism evolved during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but one can consider the advent of scientific racism and eugenics as perhaps the most crucial and paradigm shifting in relation to an evolving idea of racialism. Linnaeus, after having already taken ideas of environmental determinism from antiquity and reinforcing them with evolutionary biology, set the stage for Darwin, of course, whose influence on the leading theory of human evolution is under no doubt. It falls to reason then that a series of additional influential authors began to set the stage for Nazi Germany, and thus our modern understanding of racism. The French aristocrat and writer Arthur de Gobineau proposed three human races (black, white and yellow) in his best-known book, An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races. Arguing that "the white race originally possessed the monopoly of beauty, intelligence and strength." (Gobineau, A. 1853) Gobineau also later uses the term “Aryans” to describe the Germanic people. This work is followed eventually by Madison Grant’s The Passing of the Great Race which popularized a movement centered around his Nordic Theory, that advocated for selective breeding, compulsory sterilization, and a close alignment of public health with eugenics. (Grant, M. 2012) Interestingly enough, the concept of eugenics can itself be traced to at least as far back as Plato, who in his Republics suggested state-run selective mating in order to produce a guardian class composed of philosopher/kings. In fact, Plato’s sentiment is eerily similar to the Aryan rationalization of their state-endorsed racial hygiene ideology, when he suggests that “the best of either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior with the inferior, as seldom as possible” (P. Republic. Book V) This represents the form of pre-racism discussed earlier as much as it does Nazi eugenics, and modern racialsism. Insofar as being a form of pre-racism, we find Plato’s thoughts to be conducive of racial prejudice, albeit in this case the prejudice is such that this Guardian class is regarded as superior due to a state-willed genetic advantage. Again, it becomes clear how texts ascribed to Hippocrates, espousing ideas of environmental determinism, merge with Linnaeus’ ideas of evolutionary biology, paved the path for scientific racism at large. With potential parallels found in yet even Plato’s works, it can then be seen how Nazi Germany, with the antecedent ideas of Gobineau and Grant, thus began to redefine our established understanding of pre-racism to the more modern semantic sense that encapsulates, scientific rationalization in eugenics, environmental determinism from Antiquity, and the actual organized, systematic persecution of ethnic groups.
Ultimately, it becomes evidently clear the nature in which racialism has evolved in modern history, but also in ancient history, and yet has carried ideas of antiquity in to the modern era’s understanding of racism qua racism. There maybe those that would argue that the logical string binding the evolution of racialism throughout my rhetoric herein represents a sort of slippery slope argument, yet that can not be the case. In what is presented I have argued that a pre-racism was common and indeed prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world. I have then further argued that this pre-racism gave rise to the beginning of our modern racism through the eighteenth century. At no point is one required to make any logical leaps that contradict or change the established sense of racism, or to accept a changed stance. On the contrary, in seeing how racial prejudicial ideas of antiquity existed and have manifested scientifically as well as socio-politically in our modern understanding of racism, the argument remains cogent and sincere to its initial claims and declared scope.

On inequality, happiness, and our future

1/15/23
Some thoughts to be continued:
An emergent political order has arisen. We are in changed times. The change of today has benefited from lessons learned from change agents of the past. Like a craft which the artisan masters over time, today's change agents have colluded and usurped the message of prior thinkers. The exploiters of today do not own slaves; they employ and pay them. The exploiters of today do not aim to control the television, radio, or even the internet; they instead put forth appealing new platforms and spend their money until you are using what they want you to use. That is, until you are on their platform of choice, by your own choice, and there can be no accusation of compulsion or control. In this fundamental way, the exploiters of today are not different than those of yesterday. Adams once reminisced to Jefferson, about the war of independence in the United States:
"What do we mean by the Revolution? The War? That was no part of the Revolution. It was only an Effect and Consequence of it. The Revolution was in the Minds of the People, and this was effected , from 1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years before a drop of blood was drawn at Lexington."
Adams understood then what we have forgotten today. The small platitudes and freedoms we are or are not granted today, are granted or denied by someone. To overcome that control, Adams understood the revolution was one for mindshare. It was his vision of liberation versus the British vision pushed down on the American people. Then, as is today, change is the natural human consequence of recognizing control. The exploiters of today, then, seek control of the means of change and promote their vision for a future where this is normal, and you are happier. Their path to happiness, for you, is this hopeful view of a future painted by them, one that you will be steered towards by captains far wealthier than you. Unlike donated (that is, mandated) hope, however, fear is an emotion that swells up from within and feels deeply personal. The exploiters of today understand that if hope is a path to happiness, then fear is a path to submission. If you do not buy their vision of hope voluntarily, they scare you into submission by putting up a scarecrow future. This scarecrow represents the grim consequences coming your way if you do not align. The scarecrow puts the fear of unemployment, hunger, class war, racism, sexism, in your mind and you, by choice now, choose the merrier vision of the future or you self-exile yourself fighting an unending fight. But, opposites are mapped one to one, and unwittingly, in opposing the fears fed to you, you stroke by stroke paint yourself the same future that your exploiters tried to sell you originally through hope. The result is the same. You either buy in wittingly with hope; or are fed fears that gradually morph your view of the world to the same vision that was pushed upon you; or self-exile yourself by playing in the sandbox of identity wars. The exploiters of today do not care whether you listen to them, or whether you come to their conclusion by your own choice. As long as you board their ship in hope of a better future, and hold a definition of peace, justice and happiness, that they have put out for us, you are undoing all that the liberators of the past had done for you.
Who are these exploiters of today? The answer is simple and yet vast. Like in Socrates' parable of the cave, it is far more comfortable to live in the dark, than it is to see the true reality: there is no grand conspiracy. There are no ultra-rich men and women in Davos scheming control over your mind. Capitalism is not inherently the root of all sin and evil. Neither Biden nor Trump consciously choose to control you. On a stranded boat in the ocean with three men aboard, a two-to-one vote is a tyranny of the majority; with two men on board, each may pursue individual choice within the constraints of the shared boat. But this too must eventually become a tyranny of the fittest, either in terms of mentality, skill, or physicality. It will inevitably lead to either one vision shared by both men, or to just one man alive; two is a crowd. In survival, even without malice, there can only ever be room for one plan, that is, one vision. Your exploiters do not seek to exploit you. Rather, based on the modern rubric to grade fitness, the ultra-rich believe they are most fit and that their vision that has been successful thus far is most likely to bring success again. So, in the fight for survival, you will have a hard time having them shut up. They are not exploiting you; they are just too proud for their own good and their money amplifies their voice.
What then compels the feeling of exploitment we all feel today, if not the ultra-rich? An intelligent man once taught me, “you identify the outcomes; you identify the incentives; you change the incentives; you change the outcomes.” This view of the world compels empowered action and averts the mud fight game of blame. 
What incentives and/ or motives then compel exploitment? The profit motive is far less sinister than it is made to be. At a simple level, we today trade work for money and money for goods and services. Those goods and services require work to produce and so the cycle remains whole and perpetual. There are those that do not complete the cycle. Instead of trading their money for a good or service, and then closing the loop by working a bit more, they trade their money for a good or service that you will consume, not them. For your consumption you pay them, and they now make now make money from your consumption of their good/service, and no longer from the initial work they had put in many moons ago. 
Other forms of governance have tried to manage those two points on the cycle by either preventing the accumulation of money, or by preventing the purchasing of goods and services for the purpose of consumption by others. An example of the former is modern Scandinavia where taxation is so high that ay excess accumulation of wealth for work is immediately accounted and balanced for by the government. An example of the latter is modern Russia, or China where factors of production (that is, the things that create consumable goods and services) are controlled by the government and held from ordinary folks. In this system you may work hard and accumulate money, but by and large you will only be able to spend it lavishly on goods and services you will consume. Spending your accumulated wealth on an oil factory that will let you produce goods and services other people will consume is simply not allowed by the government. 
We thus have three ways to manage man’s productivity: 1) let citizens work as much as they can, let them save as much as they can, let them spend their savings as they wish. 2) Let citizens work as much as they can, limit the amount of savings they can accumulate through a taxes, let them spend what is left however they please. 3) let citizens work as much as they can, let them accumulate as much as they can, but limit what they can spend their money on by barring investment in factors of production and force them to only consume as they wish.
You will note, hopefully, in the above three scenarios that encompass all the options available to structure modern society, that the only constant piece of the cycle is to work as much as you can. This stage of the cycle incentivizes either extreme work to points of accepted compulsion, or promotes bare-minimum work to optimize work-life balance, depending on what the other stages look like in your country. Herein lies the stage we must focus on if we are to build a better future. In the United States, in pursuit of liberty we have a complete free-flowing cycle that grants each individual choices. The unrecognized inefficiency here is that whenever a citizen purchases a means of production as they are free to do, they have consequentially also played a role in the employment, or work, of someone else. Their decision, then, is not restricted to themselves. They are not on their own boat alone steering their ship; there is another man underneath either compelled to, or choosing to run the engine that powers the steering wheel; there are two people on the boat, and the fitter will decide where they go. Whether the man is compelled to by lack of other options, or by happy choice is at the heart of the inequality issue in western democratic society.
