## On Perspective, and the Privilege of Being Asked

One of the reasons I chose to publicize these meditations is because, over the years, I’ve found that my friends often come to me when they don’t know what to do.

In those moments — often quiet, often serious — they trust me with their uncertainty. And not just their questions, but something more sacred: the hope that I might help them see more clearly, or more calmly. I’ve always considered that to be one of the highest privileges in my life.

I don’t usually tell anyone what to do. I try not to deal in prescriptions. What I do offer, always, is how I would handle the same situation — how I’ve come to think through similar problems, or what tradeoffs I would personally be willing to make. And over time, I’ve noticed that more often than not, they act exactly as I would have. I take no pride in that — only responsibility. Because they trusted me. And I can only hope the decisions served them well.

Of course, I’ll always strive to be there when the people I love need me. But at some point, I began to wonder whether my writing — this quiet blue journal — might offer perspective to someone I’ve never met. Someone thinking the same thoughts I’ve had, but unable to name them yet. Someone standing in the same doorway I once stood in, unsure whether to enter or walk away.

So let me be clear:
I do not believe anyone should listen to me.
I reject the idea that I know what’s best for you.
But if you read something here and feel that it puts into words what you’ve already been trying to say to yourself — then I hope it gives you the clarity to act.

I believe words shape reality.
And I believe that often, we don’t need new thoughts — we just need the right language to articulate the ones we already have.
If these meditations help you give voice to what you already know but could not yet speak — then that is enough. That is more than enough.

Sometimes, a bird forgets it is in a cage until it is moved.
And sometimes, all it takes is a sentence to rattle the bars.
