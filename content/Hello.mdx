# Hello

One thing I've been thinking a lot about lately, and I think I'm going to write about in this week's newsletter, is how hard it is for people (including me) to simply state what you actually want. I wrote a little bit about this briefly last time. I wrote about figuring out what you want from life, but that's slightly different than what I'm talking about today, where it's going to be specifically about how difficult it is to just figure out what you want and how to communicate that in the moment in conversations.

One experience I had about this recently was when I was talking to a local business owner in Connecticut and I found it exceptionally difficult to say to him the things that I had planned to say to him before. The reason I found that so difficult is because I have to make actual demands.
