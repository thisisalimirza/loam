ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ali.
Iâ€™m building a freer, more impactful world â€” through systems thinking, startups, and medicine.
This is a public library of my thoughts and work. Here's how to explore:

ðŸ§  You want to read how I think?
â†’ Read My Meditations (this should take them to the meditations page)
Short, raw reflections on life, self-discipline, ambition, and meaning â€” a living notebook in the spirit of Marcus Aurelius.

â†’ [Subscribe to Thinking in Public] 
Deeper essays on systems, society, and how to build a principled life.

We build together, support each other, and grow in public and private.

ðŸ“¬ Youâ€™re a mentor, investor, or just someone a few steps ahead of me?

ðŸŽ“ Youâ€™re a student or premed who looks up to me?
â†’ [Get My Premed Resources] (this should direct them to almostmed.com)
Advice, templates, and encouragement I wish I had earlier. Join a list or access a resource hub.
