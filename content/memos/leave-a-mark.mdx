## On Purpose

It seems the prime desire for man is an ability to leave a mark. We see this even in babies with their wails and chaotic play.
As men and women we eachs pend years uncovering what our talents are, and then we seek to use those talents to leave some mark.
We cannot call this a desire for control, for control eventually is lost too. In a sense this is likely why storytelling has
remained so pervasive in humanity's history. So when one asks, "what is the purpose of life?" advise them to be not someone,
 but to become the one to someone. The extent of this scales with each's disposition, but the central rule remains. He who
 resigns himself from his purpose & from fellow man is not as good as dead, he is entirely killed.
